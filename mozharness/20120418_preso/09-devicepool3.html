<h3>More thoughts on the device pool</h3>

<p>
We need:
</p>

<ul><li>
a working mozharness device talos script, period.
</li><li>
ability to control multiple processes from a single mozharness script
</li><li>
ability to log multiple processes in mozharness separately
</li><li>
ability to request jobs -- buildbot schedules one test suite per job atm.  We want multiple test suites per job, but flexible.
</li><li>
ability to throttle jobs when the device pool is busy.  perhaps the scheduling should happen through the library?
</li><li>
ability to report multiple statuses per buildbot job
</li><li>
device library with device information, history, status
</li><li>
(Callek) set of checks to verify a device
</li><li>
a dashboard/query to visualize which tegras need rescuing, for buildduty to rescue
</li></ul>
<p>
If we reuse jhammel's comparison tool from jetperf.py, could we run on non-minis?
  <ul><li class="monospace">
Run perf test on unknown build.
  </li><li class="monospace">
Run perf test on known build.
  </li><li class="monospace">
Compare.
  </li></ul>
