<h3>A brief overview of the device pool future</h3>

<ol><li>
Buildbot master assigns a job to a build or test slave.
</li><li>
Buildbot slave runs mozharness script.
</li><li>
Mozharness script requests <i>n</i> number of free devices from device library.
<ul><li>
We don't currently have the ability to control multiple processes from a single mozharness script; that's still handwavey.
  </li><li>
We don't have the device library either.
</li></ul></li><li>
For each of these devices, make sure they're alive and good.

<ul><li class="monospace">

  </li><li class="monospace">

  </li><li class="monospace">
attempt to rescue if it's bad: reboot, format.
  </li><li class="monospace">
if it's not rescuable, return it to the library as "needs rescuing" and request another device.
  </li><li class="monospace">
We need to determine the course of action if we're unable to find <i>n</i> good devices.  Continue?  Retry later?
</li></ul></li><li>
Set up.  Create virtualenv, install app on devices, set up local web servers as needed.
</li><li>
Run tests in parallel across devices.  Logging should be separate and aggregated/summarized/reported later.
</li><li>
Report status on successful or test-failed jobs.
<ul><li>
We currently don't have the ability to report multiple statuses per buildbot job.
</li></ul></li><li>
If we had fewer devices than test suites, or if one or more test suites ended up in a RETRY scenario, initialize the devices again and run the tests that need running; report on those.
</li><li>
Post-job device cleanup.  Return devices to library, with test status; mark suspect devices as such.
</li><li>
Post-job buildbot slave cleanup.  Kill errant daemons, reboot.
</li></ol>
